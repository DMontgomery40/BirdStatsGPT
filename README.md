## Introduction
BirdStatsGPT is a custom GPT with the eBird and BirdWeather APIs, aimed at enhancing the interpretation of BirdNET / Birdweather and eBird data. You can cross reference the two databases with natural language. 

## BirdNET-Pi / Birdweather API ** Using your station token
As of this writing, a person can just put their station token into the query. I'm not quite sure why that works, as I've marked it as "Bearer", and a key that needs to be passed through the header. But, it's letting me just put tokens in for all three of my stations through the query, which is great since I'm not sure how to set it up so that anyone can use it. 

It's a feature and a bug. 

## eBird 
### Token
This is set to my token, and is secure. 
### Endpoints
Right now there are 10 endpoints, so, since it's the eBird API, only a few hundered left to add :)
