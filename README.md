# BirdStatsGPT

## Introduction
BirdStatsGPT is a custom GPT that combines the strengths of OpenAI's LLM with the eBird and BirdWeather APIs, aimed at enhancing BirdNET analysis. This project is a nod to the incredible work done in the fields of ornithology and technology, and it's an effort to contribute to this vibrant community.


## Project Background
Rooted in a deep appreciation for the avian world, BirdStats GPT is an endeavor to merge birdwatching data with the evolving world of AI. The objective is to build upon existing technologies, offering a unique perspective on bird data analysis and visualization.

## Setup Challenges
As I navigate through the early stages of this project, I'm focusing on the integration of different APIs. It's a learning curve, becuase I'm VERY new to this :)

## Contributing and Acknowledgements
This project thrives on community collaboration. A special shout-out to the creators and maintainers of the eBird, BirdWeather, and OpenAI GPT APIs â€“ particularly Tim, who's been instrumental with BirdWeather. Your work inspires and enables projects like this.

## Current Technical Roadblocks
- **eBird API**: Running into some 401 errors that need resolving, both with private and public/test API keys.
- **BirdWeather API**: Working on getting the GraphQL API structure right; the REST API is, as of 2025-12-25, functional.
- **BirdBuddy API** I am nowhere with this...

While these might not be groundbreaking challenges for API wizards, they are crucial steps for the project. Your expertise, suggestions, and contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support and for being a part of this birdwatching-tech journey!
